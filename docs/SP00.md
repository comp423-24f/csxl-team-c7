# Organization Page: Tejas C, Tyler N, Aneesh S, Sam T

## Overview: These features allow full access for admin control over organization management within the CSXL website. Organization leaders will now be able to accept members, view member applications, change leadership, and post messages all in the CSXL site. Members can also use this to request to join organizations, and view messages here as well. This allows a consolidated platform for members to view all of their organizations in one page, and for admins to direct members into a single site.

## Key Personas:

Organization Head: These are the club presidents of captains of each organization, such as ACM or Chapel Hill AR/VR, that have the “admin” ability for their organizations. They can accept new members, allow or deny applications, and make changes to the club information and events. This allows an online platform that is a part of the overall unofficial UNC CS website for these admins to use and correlate their organization with UNC CS. The ease of allowing more attention to their organization and a central site for their actions can expand their club reach and organizational capabilities.

Members: These are the students of UNC in CS who are looking at club information, applying to clubs, leaving clubs, and overall being engaged in UNC CS club atmosphere on a single website. A student who wants to get some experience with VR/AR research can apply to the club, see when events and workshops are that apply to their interests and attend those.
Organization Head/Member Relationship: Overall this allows for easier connection between leaders of clubs and current club members or prospective club members. It’s much easier to stay involved and find interesting clubs and attend events than on the previous overall club site of handshake. The needs and goals of both parties will be met and the deeper connectivity as a result will further benefit UNC Computer Science.

## User Stories organized by persona, necessity for a minimum-viable feature, and frequency/importance of use.

### Persona 1: Organization Head

- User Story 1: As an organization head, I want to be able to accept or deny applications to my organization so that the club can remain exclusive and managed. This should all occur in-house through the CSXL website. This should attempt to replace any Google Form or any third party application.
  Necessity: Need
  Frequency: Application Cycles or Daily
- User Story 2: As an organization head, I want to edit details about my organization such as name and description, so I can keep information about the club up to date and attract interest. This should act as the official page for organizations except their website, for future members to view and interact with.
  Necessity: Need
  Frequency: Occasionally
- User Story 3: As an organization head, I want to be able to publish posts that have announcements on events and important information so I can inform my members about upcoming things and details that are relevant to them. This should act as the main communication hub between admin and members where members are officially updated with upcoming events.
  Necessity: Need
  Frequency: Daily
- User Story 4: As an organization head, I want to be able to pass on leadership and roles to other people so that there is a smooth transition between leadership and other captains have admin rights. This should be limited to admins, and should accurately reflect the hierarchal status of an organization. Members should use this function to find people to ask questions to regarding the organization.
  Necessity: Need
  Frequency: Occasionally
- User Story 5: As an organization head, I want to be able to see profiles of members and applicants so that I can make informed decisions regarding applications or just learning more about members. This should act as the main hub for organizations to maintain their organizations. Being included makes you an official member, and leaving stops inclusion.
  Necessity: Want
  Frequency: Daily

### Persona 2: Members

- User Story 1: As a member, I want to see all the available UNC CS clubs so that I can decide which ones are interesting by reading the descriptions. This should act as the current HeelLife CS organization page, but hosted on CSXL.
  Necessity: Need
  Frequency: Daily
- User Story 2: As a member, I want to apply to whichever organizations I want so that I can join a club by giving them details about myself and showcasing my interest. This should replace Google Forms, or should be able to host Google forms through the use of an API to convey applications from members to admin.
  Necessity: Need
  Frequency: Application Cycles or Daily
- User Story 3: As a member, I want to see the posts my admins decide to publish so that I can stay up to date on events that are happening and important information about the club. This should act as the main hub for information, replacing or aiding communications on slack/discord/any other third party platform.
  Necessity: Need
  Frequency: Daily
- User Story 4: As a member, I want to be able to send messages to club admins so that I can keep in contact throughout application processes or about other details. This should act as a primary function of messaging between members and admins.
  Necessity: Want
  Frequency: Daily
- User Story 5: As a member, I want to be able to accept or decline invites from clubs so that I can choose to become part of an organization or not. This should effectively act as choosing to join an organization officially.
  Necessity: Want
  Frequency: Daily
- User Story 6: As a member, I want to be able to leave a club so that I can choose what I am a part of. This functionality should be visible to everyone with member view privileges, and should effectively act as leaving the club officially.
  Necessity: Want
  Frequency: Daily

## Technical Implementation Opportunities and Planning

- What specific areas of the existing code base will you directly depend upon, extend, or integrate with?
  The existing areas of code that we will directly depend on are the CSXL frontend components and widgets, backend API endpoints and CRUD operations, and the CSXL database. The database draws from existing information we have stored in CSXL such as applicant profiles or club pages, these are then connected to our Figma widgets which offer interactive components to users and are connected to the backends through APIs. CRUD operations further help the flow, storage, and retrieval of information.

- What planned page components and widgets do you anticipate needing in your feature’s frontend?
  We plan on using buttons, cards, chips, lists, icons, radio buttons, switches, and search fields. These will all work mostly for user benefit in terms of easy usage and readability and then ease for admins to have control over their club pages and usage.

- What additional models, or changes to existing models, do you foresee needing (if any)?
  We will need to change the organization card model, as well as the organization detail model. For the organization card model, we have to add a status indicator of the organization, application / join button, and admin control. In the organization details model, we need to add lists to display members and officers of the organization, drop downs on members to be able to change their status in the org, and another admin control to accept or deny members requests for admin control. For applicants, we may have to add that their name is linked to their profile or something that reveals more information about them.

- Considering your most-frequently used and critical user stories, what API / Routes do you foresee modifying or needing to add?
  CREATE:
  Accepting/ adding members to the organization
  READ:
  Retrieve members by term
  UPDATE:
  Changing the status of members/officers
  Giving or taking away admin control from members
  DELETE:
  Removing members from members list
  Removing officers from officers list

- What concerns exist for security and privacy of data? Should the capabilities you are implementing be specific to only certain users or roles? (For example: When Sally Student makes a reservation, only Sally Student or Amy Ambassador should be able to cancel the reservation. Another student, such as Sam Student, should not be able to cancel Sally’s reservation.)
  Only the president of an organization or certain officers will have the ability to accept members into the organization. Only the president should be able to authorize admin control to others. If admin control is granted, that student can only use it to edit CSXL website info and event info, they will not have the same access as the president or admin. Also students should not be able to see other applicants, or other information that the club admins have access to that could lead to private club information being leaked such as club funds.
